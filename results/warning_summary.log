----SYNTHESIS----
WARNING: [Synth 8-6014] Unused sequential element set_x.inc_reg was removed.  [rtl/mouse/MouseCtl.vhd:450]
WARNING: [Synth 8-6014] Unused sequential element set_x.x_inter_reg was removed.  [rtl/mouse/MouseCtl.vhd:456]
WARNING: [Synth 8-6014] Unused sequential element set_y.inc_reg was removed.  [rtl/mouse/MouseCtl.vhd:514]
WARNING: [Synth 8-6014] Unused sequential element set_y.y_inter_reg was removed.  [rtl/mouse/MouseCtl.vhd:520]
WARNING: [Synth 8-7080] Parallel synthesis criteria is not met
WARNING: [Synth 8-5835] Resources of type BRAM have been overutilized. Used = 114, Available = 100. Will try to implement using LUT-RAM. 

----IMPLEMENTATION----
WARNING: [Power 33-332] Found switching activity that implies high-fanout reset nets being asserted for excessive periods of time which may result in inaccurate power analysis.
