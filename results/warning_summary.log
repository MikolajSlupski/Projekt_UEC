WARNING: [Route 35-468] The router encountered 31 pins that are both setup-critical and hold-critical and tried to fix hold violations at the expense of setup slack. Such pins are:
WARNING: [Route 35-328] Router estimated timing not met.
CRITICAL WARNING: [Timing 38-282] The design failed to meet the timing requirements. Please see the timing summary report for details on the timing violations.
