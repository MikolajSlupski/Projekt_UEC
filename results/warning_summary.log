CRITICAL WARNING: [Shape Builder 18-119] Failed to create I/OLOGIC Route Through shape for instance u_clk_wiz_0_clk_wiz/clkin1_ibufg. Found overlapping instances within the shape: u_clk_65MHz/clkin1_ibufg and u_clk_wiz_0_clk_wiz/clkin1_ibufg.
INFO: [runtcl-6] Synthesis results are not added to the cache due to CRITICAL_WARNING

----IMPLEMENTATION----
WARNING: [Route 35-468] The router encountered 9 pins that are both setup-critical and hold-critical and tried to fix hold violations at the expense of setup slack. Such pins are:
WARNING: [Route 35-328] Router estimated timing not met.
CRITICAL WARNING: [Timing 38-282] The design failed to meet the timing requirements. Please see the timing summary report for details on the timing violations.
