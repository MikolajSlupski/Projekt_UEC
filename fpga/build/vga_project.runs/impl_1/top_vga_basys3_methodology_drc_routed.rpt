2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-51#1 Critical Warning
No common phase between related clocks from parallel CMBs  
The clocks clk100MHz_clk_wiz_0 and clk_65MHz_clk_Projekt_65MHz are timed together but have no phase relationship. The design could fail in hardware. The clocks originate from two parallel Clock Modifying Blocks and at least one of the MMCM or PLLs clock dividers is not set to 1. To be safely timed, all MMCMs or PLLs involved in parallel clocking must have the clock divider set to 1.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-51#2 Critical Warning
No common phase between related clocks from parallel CMBs  
The clocks clk_65MHz_clk_Projekt_65MHz and clk100MHz_clk_wiz_0 are timed together but have no phase relationship. The design could fail in hardware. The clocks originate from two parallel Clock Modifying Blocks and at least one of the MMCM or PLLs clock dividers is not set to 1. To be safely timed, all MMCMs or PLLs involved in parallel clocking must have the clock divider set to 1.
